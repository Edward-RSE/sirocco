This directory contains help files created from doc strings from
python scripts in the py_progs directory.  

To create the documentation yourself, simply run `write_docs.py`.

This procedure should be largely superseded by https://agnwinds.readthedocs.io/en/dev/py_progs.html but that page is not currently complete.
