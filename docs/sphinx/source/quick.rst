*Quick Guide to Sirocco*
########################################

This guide is intended to allow users to install Sirocco, to run Sirocco as a
computer program and then to check whether the run has completed as expected.

It does not describe (except in passing) any information about the physics of
Sirocco, the details of a particular wind model, or criteria for evaluating whether
the inputs correspond to a plausible model of an astrophysical system.
