Wind.radiation
==============
Whether or not the wind should radiate. Wind.radiation is an available parameter when the user selects a simple atom case with the :ref:`Line_transfer` parameter option. Macro atoms cases do not have this option. Wind.radiation allows the wind to scatter, absorb and emit photons through various processes, such as bound-bound, free-free, and recombination.  It is the default for simple radiative transfer.

Type
  Boolean (yes/no)
