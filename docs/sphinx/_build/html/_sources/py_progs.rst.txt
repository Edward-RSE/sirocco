Python Scripts
##############

There are several `Python` (the scripting language) scripts written to prepare input for
and analyse the output of *python* (the C code).

Some of the more useful scripts/modules are documented below. Alternatively, you can generate documentation 
for all the scripts by navigating to :code:`docs/pydocs` and running :code:`write_docs.py`. The resulting output file can be found `here <../../pydocs/doc_index.html>`_.

.. admonition :: Warning to user

    The scripts documented here form an incomplete and inhomogenous list, in the sense that they have been developed by different people at different times and do not fit nicely together as a single python package. Some of the scripts should still be useful, particularly if you consult example notebookes, but use with caution!
