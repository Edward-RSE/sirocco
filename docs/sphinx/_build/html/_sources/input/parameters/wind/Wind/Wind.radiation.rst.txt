Wind.radiation
==============
Whether or not the wind should radiate. Wind.radiation is an parameter enabled when a simple atom case is selected with the Line_transfer parameter option. This is not true with macro atom cases. This parameter allows for wind not only to scatter and absorb photons, but also to emit them by various processes, bound-bound, free-free, and recombination.  It is the default for simple radiative transfer.
